Dear Editor,

this manuscript has evolved out of the rejected manuscript JFP-2013-0020.

In comparison to that, it contains the first formally verified adequacy proof
for Launchbury's semantics, which is the main contribution of the manuscript.
The discussion of the formal mistake in Launchbury's paper is deemphasized (but
still included), and no alternative natural semantics is proposed. All in all
we believe the differences are large enough to consider this to be a new
manuscript.

One reviewer of JFP-2013-0020 was worried about the relationship between the
journal manuscript and the Isabelle formalization hosted at the Archive of
Formal Proofs, and whether the publication there diminishes the contribution of
this manuscript. I argue it does not: The AFP referees evaluate the Isabelle
code, e.g. that there are no unfinished lemmas left, but usually not what the
code is used for, i.e. whether the proved theorems are worthwhile. Furthermore,
the Isabelle theories there are usually uncommented, and one contribution of
the accompanying “human readable” publication is the digestion and explanation
of the formal development for the non-Isabelle-speaking reader. It is analogue
to having an implementation of a system published somewhere where the code is
being reviewed, but still having a “proper” paper describing the system.

Thanks, Joachim Breitner
